In a previous post, I discussed verifying file hashes using PowerShell. Now that PowerShell is cross-platform, this means it will work on any operating system that supports it, particularly the usual suspectsâ€”Windows, Linux, and macOS.

However, what are your options if you don't have access to PowerShell?

The default shells on Linux and macOS support this via the [shasum](https://linux.die.net/man/1/shasum) command.

Let us again use our example, the utility [HandBrake](https://handbrake.fr/).

To verify the `SHA-265` checksum, we would do it as follows:

```bash
shasum -a 256 HandBrake-1.9.2.dmg
```

The `-a` allows you to specify an algorithm.

You should get the following output:

The available options are

| Parameter | Algorithm |
| --------- | --------- |
| 1         | SHA-1     |
| 224       | SHA-224   |
| 256       | SHA-265   |
| 384       | SHA-384   |
| 512       | SHA-512   |

If you don't specify an algorithm, `SHA-1` will be used.

### TLDR

**The `shasum` command allows for the generation of checksums using various algorithms on *bash* and *zsh* shells**

Happy hacking!
