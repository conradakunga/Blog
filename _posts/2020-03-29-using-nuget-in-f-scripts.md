One of the brilliant improvements in F# 4.7 is the ability to make use of Nuget packages in your scripts.

This makes it very convenient to experiment with code without having to create an actual project.

This is accomplished using the #r **&#8220;nuget: {PACKAGE-NAME}.Json&#8221;** decleration.

For example I have some code here that downloads the sunrise and sunset times in Nairobi and prints them to console

This code makes of **Newtonsoft.Json** and **HttpClient** libraries.

The web service I am using is the [Sunshine Sunset api](https://sunrise-sunset.org/api), that takes as parameters the latitude and longitude of the desired location (a quick google away!)

The response itself looks like this

[<img style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="29 Mar 2" src="images/2020/03/29-Mar-2_thumb.png" alt="29 Mar 2" width="579" height="376" border="0" />](images/2020/03/29-Mar-2.png)

First the is the root, that contains the **status** (a string) and the **results** (a nested object)

I have created a number of simple types to capture only the data that I am interested in that will be deserialized into from the JSON response.

The code is as follows:

[<img style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="29 Mar 1" src="images/2020/03/29-Mar-1_thumb.png" alt="29 Mar 1" width="1051" height="666" border="0" />](images/2020/03/29-Mar-1.png)

Save it in a file, **Script.fsx**

You can run it using the **dotnet fsi** tool as follows:

[<img style="display: inline; background-image: none;" title="29 Mar 3" src="images/2020/03/29-Mar-3_thumb.png" alt="29 Mar 3" width="619" height="115" border="0" />](images/2020/03/29-Mar-3.png)

You must include the **â€“langversion:preview** or the Nuget functionality will not work.

You can get the source code for the script on my [github](https://github.com/conradakunga/BlogCode/tree/master/29%20March%202020%20-%20Nuget%20From%20F%23%20Scripts)

Happy hacking!
