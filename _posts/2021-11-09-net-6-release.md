The final release of .NET 6 is now available.
  
You can get the final bits [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Remember that .NET is cross platform so you can select the appropriate sections to download the bits for your operating system

A nice touch is that docker images are also available!

Click **All Downloads** so you can select the bits that you want:
- SDK (Includes all the runtimes)
- ASP.NET Core Runtime
- Desktop runtime

Happy hacking!
