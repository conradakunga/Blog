This is the dialog I saw when I launched [Oracle VM VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) today.

Pretty useful, at first glance.

Except for the fact that **none of those links are clickable**. They may look like links but they aren't.

You may think that a quick solution is to `Ctrl + C`, which should [get you the text of a message box](https://winaero.com/copy-text-message-box-windows-10/).

Except that this doesn't work either. Nothing gets copied to the clipboard.

**Fail.**

Things that look like clickable hyperlinks should be clickable hyperlinks

Happy hacking!
