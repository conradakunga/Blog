Occasionally you will hear somebody say, (or you yourself may say) something like:

> Software nowadays is bloated

What is bloat, anyway?

From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bloat)

> Software bloat is a process whereby successive versions of a computer program become perceptibly slower, use more memory, disk space or processing power, or have higher hardware requirements than the previous version â€” while making only dubious user-perceptible improvements or suffering from feature creep.
