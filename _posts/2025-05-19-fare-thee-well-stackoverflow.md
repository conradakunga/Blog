Let us take a moment to remember [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) fondly.

I don't think anyone who has ever written software either professionally or as a hobbyist has not at some point or another found themselves there seeking answers.

Like many others, I also created a [profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/1349/rad) there.

I can see that was a clean 16 years ago!

I have asked a question or two, and answered many in my few years in the industry.

I recently came across a tweet from @[marcgravell](https://x.com/marcgravell/) that had this telling graphic:

The reality is [the times they are a changing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90WD_ats6eE) - and people are more likely to ask ChatGPT or any such AI assistant for not just answers, but actual working code.

### TLDR

**StackOverflow is a casualty of the times.**

Happy hacking!
