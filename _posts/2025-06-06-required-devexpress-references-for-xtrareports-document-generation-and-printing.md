For many years, I have used the excellent [DevExpress](https://www.devexpress.com/) Component suite for my applications, and in particular for

1. [Reporting](https://www.devexpress.com/subscriptions/reporting/)
2. [Document generation and manipulation](https://www.devexpress.com/products/net/office-file-api/)
3. [UI components](https://js.devexpress.com/)

When deploying an application that **generates** and **prints** documents generated by **XtraReports**, make sure to reference the following libraries:

- DevExpress.Charts.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.CodeParser.v23.2
- DevExpress.Data.Desktop.v23.2
- DevExpress.Data.v23.2
- DevExpress.DataAccess.v23.2
- DevExpress.Docs.v23.2
- DevExpress.Drawing.v23.2
- DevExpress.Office.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.Pdf.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.Pdf.v23.2.Drawing
- DevExpress.PivotGrid.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.Printing.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.RichEdit.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.RichEdit.v23.2.Export
- DevExpress.Sparkline.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.Utils.v23.2
- DevExpress.Utils.v23.2.UI
- DevExpress.XtraCharts.v23.2
- DevExpress.XtraCharts.v23.2.Wizard
- DevExpress.XtraEditors.v23.2
- DevExpress.XtraGauges.v23.2.Core
- DevExpress.XtraPrinting.v23.2
- DevExpress.XtraReports.v23.2
- DevExpress.XtraReports.v23.2.Extensions

**Replace as appropriate** for the **DevExpress** version you have installed.

### TLDR

**Some DevExpress libraries must be explicitly packaged for deployment when generating and printing reports and documents.**

Happy hacking!
