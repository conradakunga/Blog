In our last post, we looked at how to virtualize infrastructure such as database engines ([SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) and [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)).

In this post, we will look at how to better organize our tests.

Currently, if you look at the **test runner**, all the tests look like this:

![AllTests](../images/2025/04/AllTests.png)

This is a mix of **unit** tests, **integration** tests and **behaviour** tests.

Wouldn't it be nice if they could be **categorized** as such?

This is possible using the `Trait` attribute.

We can decorate each test class as appropriate.

For the [unit tests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing):

```c#
[Trait("Type", "Unit")]
public class AesFileEncryptorTests
```

The `behavior` tests:

```c#
[Trait("Type", "Behaviour")]
public class UploadFileManagerTests
```

The integration tests:

```c#
[Trait("Type", "Integration")]
public class PostgreSQLStorageEngineTests
```

The test runner will now look like this (depending on your IDE of choice)

![TestTraits](../images/2025/05/TestTraits.png)

This makes it easier to **visualize** and **run** the tests. For example, if you want to run only the `unit` tests, you can **right click** that node and run them all collectively:

![UnitTests](../images/2025/05/UnitTests.png)

### TLDR

**`Traits` allow for the organization of tests to make the testing experience smoother.**

The code is in my [GitHub](https://github.com/conradakunga/UploadFileManager).

Happy hacking!
