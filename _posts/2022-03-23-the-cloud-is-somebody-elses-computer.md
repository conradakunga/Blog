One of the interesting developments over the past week has been this - NoSQL cloud database provider [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) has [suspended the accounts of it's Russia & Belarus customers](https://www.theregister.com/2022/03/15/mongodb_terminates_russian_saas/).

Ostensibly this is due to recent geopolitical developments between Russia and Ukraine.

But here is the thing - the actual reason is irrelevant.

There are lots of reasons for a critical cloud service you are relying on to be unavailable for a sustained period.

1. Political reasons, as above
2. Account suspension due to violation of terms of service, or other reasons. The web is full of [many](https://medium.com/@davidkibzodari/google-play-account-termination-on-a-new-account-7160dbdd4784) [such](https://africa.businessinsider.com/tech/what-its-like-to-get-locked-out-of-google-indefinitely/el9qmrv) horror stories.
3. The product or service is discontinued
4. Scheduled, or unscheduled service outage.
