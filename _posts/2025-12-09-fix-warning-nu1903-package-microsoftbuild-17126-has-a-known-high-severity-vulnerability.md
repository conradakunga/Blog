Recently, I began to get the following **warning** on a project I was updating:

```bash
GNU bash, version 3.2.57(1)-release (arm64-apple-darwin24)
Microsoft (R) .NET SDK version 10.0.101
/Users/rad/Projects/innova.integration.corebanking/build/_build.csproj : warning NU1903: Package 'Microsoft.Build' 17.12.6 has a known high severity vulnerability, https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w3q9-fxm7-j8fq

```

Of course, my first port of call was to check the project file (`.csproj`) for the project that was the source of this warning.

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <NukeRootDirectory>..</NukeRootDirectory>
    <NukeScriptDirectory>..</NukeScriptDirectory>
    <NukeTelemetryVersion>1</NukeTelemetryVersion>
    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Nuke.Common" Version="9.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageDownload Include="GitVersion.Tool" Version="[5.12.0]" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>

```

Strangely enough, the packages that were complaining were **not referenced at all**!

This indicated that they were a **transient dependency** on one (or both) of the referenced packages in the file.

The solution was simple enough: install the packages directly.

I ran the following commands in the console:

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.Build
dotnet add package Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core
dotnet add package Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core
```

This updated the `.csproj` file such that it looked like this:

```xml
<Project Sdk="Microsoft.NET.Sdk">
  <PropertyGroup>
    <OutputType>Exe</OutputType>
    <TargetFramework>net10.0</TargetFramework>
    <NukeRootDirectory>..</NukeRootDirectory>
    <NukeScriptDirectory>..</NukeScriptDirectory>
    <NukeTelemetryVersion>1</NukeTelemetryVersion>
    <IsPackable>false</IsPackable>
  </PropertyGroup>

  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build" Version="18.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build.Tasks.Core" Version="18.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="Microsoft.Build.Utilities.Core" Version="18.0.2" />
    <PackageReference Include="Nuke.Common" Version="9.0.4" />
  </ItemGroup>
  <ItemGroup>
    <PackageDownload Include="GitVersion.Tool" Version="[5.12.0]" />
  </ItemGroup>
</Project>
```

The warning no longer appears.

### TLDR

**Directly installing and updating MSBuild packages eliminates the error about vulnerable versions in use.**

Happy hacking!
