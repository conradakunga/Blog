After installing an [operating system](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/operating-systems) on your device, the various files, libraries and executables are stored in what is called the [system directory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/system-directory).

In [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows), it is usually `C:\Windows\System32`

But **not always**! The user can decide to install it to any other drive, perhaps `D:` or `E:`

Further, this has (historically) been different depending on the flavour and version of the operating system. For example, in [Windows NT 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_4.0) it was `C:\WINNT\System32`.

In short - **you cannot make any assumptions** as to where this is.

You will need to **ask the operating system** to provide this.

You can access this through the [SystemDirectory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.systemdirectory?view=net-9.0) property of the [Environment](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment?view=net-9.0) object.

```c#
var systemDirectory = Environment.SystemDirectory;
Console.WriteLine(systemDirectory);
```

On **Windows**, it returns this:

```plaintext
C:\WINDOWS\system32
```

On [macOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MacOS_Sequoia) (Sequoia) it returns this:

```plaintext
/System
```

On **Linux** ([Ubuntu 24.04.3](https://ubuntu.com/blog/tag/ubuntu-24-04-lts)) it returns an empty string.

If you needed to get the System root itself, we can use the [GetPathRoot](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.path.getpathroot?view=net-9.0#system-io-path-getpathroot(system-string)) method of the [Path](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.io.path?view=net-9.0) class.

```c#

```

On **Windows**, it returns this:

```plaintext
C:\
```

On **macOS** it returns this:

```plaintext
/
```

### TLDR

**You can get the *system folder* using `Environment.SystemDirectory`, which we can subsequently use to get the *system root*.**

Happy hacking!
