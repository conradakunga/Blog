The previous post, "[About The SQL Server 2022 Editions]({% post_url 2025-10-12-about-the-sql-server-2022-editions %})", discussed the various editions of [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server) available for use in **development** and **production**.

One of the challenges outlined was if you use the **developer** edition, which has **feature parity with the enterprise edition**, it is possible to run into problems of functionality and performance if you use **features in the developer edition that are not available** in the edition you are deploying to - **standard**, **web** or **express**.

[SQL Server 2025](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/evalcenter/evaluate-sql-server-2025), currently in **preview**, has a novel solution to this:.

These are the available editions of SQL Server 2025:

| Edition                  | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Express                  | Free, entry level database                                   |
| Web                      | Low cost edtiion primary for web hosting scenarios           |
| Standard                 | Edition with standard funcitonality to support small enterprise as a database management system and business intelligece platform |
| **Standard Developer**   | This is the same as the enterpise version, but only licensed for development use |
| Enterprise               | Premium edition with all the bells and whistles, including virtualization |
| **Enterprise Developer** | This is the same as the enterpise version, but only licensed for development use |

As you can see, there are **two different editions** for developers - **standard developer** and **enterprise developer.**

This means that out of the gate, you can **use the appropriate version** targeting the deployment edition and avoid surprises on deployment and use.

### TLDR

**SQL Server 2025 has two editions for developers - *standard developer* and *enterprise developer* to allow developers to safely build and test applications with the exact features that will be available at deployment.**

Happy hacking!
