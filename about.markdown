I have been writing software professionally for decades. 

In this blog I will be writing primarily about:

1. **The Business of software**
2. **Software development**

The posts on software development assume no, or litte, prior knowledge of the subject matter and therefore should be useful regardless of your level of experience.

I am an entrepreneur, and co-founder of [Innova Limited](http://www.innova.co.ke/), where I lead the research and product development.

I am also the co-founder and a trustee of [Mzalendo Trust](https://mzalendo.com).

I have a keen interest in technology and software development in particular. I have architected, designed and developed solutions in supply chain, knowledge management, fintech and agritech.

My work is currently running in production in 10 countries across various industries.

For the last 15 years I have specialized in the fintech space and in particular capital markets. I have also designed and built dozens of integrations to core banking systems, accounting systems and payment gateways.

Some of the organizations I have worked with in developing solutions include

My focus is

* Systems integration

Over the years I have had the opportunity to work on several technology stacks including ASP.NET, C, C++, Python, PHP, Java, Visual Basic, Visual Basic.NET, Delphi, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Sybase, SQLite and Oracle.

My current specialization is the .NET platform and in particular C# and F#. I have been a Microsoft MVP for over 15 years.

I have a passion for learning, teaching and mentorship to share my knowledge, as well as consulting.
